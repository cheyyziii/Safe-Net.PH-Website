     <h1 class="fade-in delay-1">Types of Scams</h1>
    <ul class="fade-in delay-2">
        <li><b>Invoice fraud:</b>
        This is when criminals compromise or impersonate a vendor‚Äôs email account. 
        They can then change the bank details on the company's invoices. 
        The customer pays the invoice, thinking they are paying the vendor, 
        but instead send that money to criminals‚Äô bank accounts. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Phishing emails and texts:</b>
        Phishing is a‚ÄØway cybercriminals‚ÄØtrick you into giving them personal 
        information. They do this by sending fake emails or text messages that look
        like they come from a person or organisation you trust. These scams could 
        include a link to a fake login page or attachment. If you fall for it, you 
        could lose money and access to your accounts, or even have your identity 
        stolen. An example of this would be receiving an email with a link to a 
        fake bank website asking for your login details. Giving this away could 
        compromise your accounts.
        </li>
        <li><b>Remote access scams:</b>
        Remote access scams are when a malicious actor gain access to your system 
        or device from another location. This could be done with your help, after 
        tricking or convincing you to click on their link or download software to 
        give them access. For example, someone claiming to be a tech specialist may 
        request access to your system to help you with troubleshooting issues that do 
        not exist, in order to access your device.
        </li>
        <li><b>Identity theft:</b>
        Identity theft is where a cybercriminal extracts or gains access to your 
        personal documents such as your passport, licence, birth certificate or even 
        a photo of you on your electronic device or emails, to steal your identity. 
        This could allow them to withdraw money from your financial accounts, or apply 
        for a new credit card or bank loans in your name.
        </li>
        <li><b>Threats and extortion:</b>
        These scams use threats to frighten you into giving away money. It can include 
        threats to your life, arrests or deportation. Scammers have been known to target 
        vulnerable people like elderly or migrants. For example, they may pretend to be 
        government officials from the Department of Home Affairs or the Australian Federal 
        Police, and tell you that there are problems with your visa or immigration papers, 
        threatening to deport you unless fees are paid. Another common scam is when cybercriminals 
        pretend to be from the Australian Taxation Office, and ask for payment for 
        outstanding tax debts. They will threaten arrest or legal action if you do not 
        comply.
        </li>
        <li><b>Dating and romance scams:</b>
        Cybercriminals target victims on dating websites and apps pretending to be 
        other people. Scammers start the relationship with their victim on the website 
        or app before moving the conversation to a more 'private' channel. This is to 
        move away from the protections that dating sites put in place. Cybercriminals 
        can easily manipulate their victims on other channels like email or text. They 
        create fake profiles online or take the identities of real people. Cybercriminals 
        try to quickly build a relationship, and then ask for money, gifts or information.
        </li>
        <li><b>Investment or cryptocurrency scams:</b>
        Cybercriminals entice victims into investing money in schemes which may offer 
        high and quick returns. This type of scam is typically a time-sensitive offer 
        to pressure you into making a decision fast.

        <b>Cybersecurity is key:</b>
        When cybersecurity is inadequate, it can lead to stolen identity and financial 
        loss. Most scams and scammers have two main goals--to steal your money and your 
        identity. You should know what to look for, how they work, and what to do, so you 
        can protect yourself and your finances.
      </p><br>
      <p class="fade-in delay-3">
        <b>Maintain cybersecurity:</b> Maintaining cybersecurity  is very important, even for consumers. It is not 
        simply something that concerns large corporations and other businesses. 
        Here are some steps you can take:
      </p><br>
      <ul class="fade-in delay-4">
      <li> 
        <b>Do not open email from people you don‚Äôt know:</b>
        If you are unsure whether an email you received is legitimate, 
        try contacting the sender directly via other means. Do not click on any 
        links in an email unless you are sure it is safe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Be careful with links and new website addresses:</b>
        Malicious website addresses may appear almost identical to legitimate 
        sites. Scammers often use a slight variation in spelling or logo to lure 
        you. Malicious links can also come from friends whose email has unknowingly 
        been compromised, so be careful.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Secure your personal information:</b>
        Before providing any personal information, such as your date of birth, 
        Social Security number, account numbers, and passwords, be sure the website 
        is secure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Stay informed on the latest cyber threats:</b>
        Keep yourself up to date on current scams. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
        Security Agency (CISA) can provide you with Alerts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Use Strong Passwords:</b> Strong passwords are critical to online security. Review 
        CISA guidance on Choosing and Protecting Passwords.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Keep your software up to date and maintain preventative software programs:</b>
        Keep all of your software applications up to date on your computers and mobile 
        devices. Install software that provides antivirus, firewall, and email filter 
        services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Update the operating systems on your electronic devices:</b>
        Make sure your operating systems (OSs) and applications are up to date on 
        all of your electronic devices. Older and unpatched versions of OSs and software 
        are the target of many hacks.
